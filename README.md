# The third animal that follows the pair llama and alpaca is guanaco: 
## Seeding, Tuning, Generating, and the problem of critical intervention in Large Language Models

The third animal that follows the pair llama and alpaca is guanaco.

This is the code repository for the 'Guanaco' lesson plan contained in *Peripheral: teaching digital cultures in chaotic times*, published by *The Institute of Network Cultures*. Follow along with the lesson via the journal: *link TBC*.

Note: Guanaco is a hypothetical AI model for research and educational purposes.

## Overview

In February 2023 Meta released LLaMA, a set of large language models trained on billions of parameters. In March 2023 Stanford University researchers released [Alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca), a model of LLaMA fine-tuned on a synthetic dataset of 52,000 instruction parameters which had been generated by ChatGPT3 from 175 human-written instructions. Both the 175 human instructions and the 52 thousand generated parameters are publicly available on the [research team’s github](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca). The Stanford team’s raison d’être for the project was to provide a way of encouraging researchers to develop models which would overcome known ‘deficiencies’ in generative AI, especially the tendency to “generate false information, propagate social stereotypes, and produce toxic language”. 

Days later however, the live model was taken down due to ‘safety issues’ — despite its enlightened origins, the model displayed a noted tendency towards ‘hallucinating’ falsehoods and the production of ‘[offensive text](https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/21/stanford_ai_alpaca_taken_offline/)’.

The question is — why then did Alpaca fail, and what is it to ‘fine-tune’ an AI model? Thao Phan and Fabian Offert have criticised some recent efforts to ‘debias’ generative AI models as superficial, as failing especially to confront “the consistent reproduction of whiteness as a latent feature of dominant…culture” ([2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06323)). To what extent can a model be ‘tuned’ beyond or outside or against its foundational parameters and weightings? 

The lesson proposed [here](https://networkcultures.org) takes two steps. In the first the classroom will be invited to compare Alpaca’s 175 human instructions with the 52,000 GPT3-generated instruction parameters — how do categories of race, gender, sexuality and the political appear differently in the human generated and machine generated prompts? What does this difference reveal about the way the LLM transforms human intentionality, desires, and political engagements?

The second part of the lesson will be to generate a new AI model within the camelid family, Guanaco. After reflecting on a series of critical AI texts, the classroom will collectively devise their own AI model by manually writing 175 original seed tasks, with ideas of race, gender, sexuality and the political front of mind. GPT3.5 is then prompted to generate an additional thousand tasks based on the seed-set created within the classroom.

Students will be asked to reflect upon the relation between seed, generation, and hallucination. To what degree is political intervention possible in large language models? To what degree can experiments in tuning make present and detourn models’ foundations, and what consequences do such experiments have in a chaotic age of increasingly accessible and normalised access to generative AI?

## Data Generation Process

<details>
<summary> <strong> Running the code </strong> </summary>

1. Set environment variables `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your OpenAI API key.
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `python -m generate_instruction generate_instruction_following_data` to generate the data.

</details>

We built on the data generation pipeline from [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct) and made the following modifications:

- We used `text-davinci-003` to generate the instruction data instead of `davinci`.
- We wrote a new prompt (`prompt.txt`) that explicitly gave the requirement of instruction generation to `text-davinci-003`. Note: there is a slight error in the prompt we used, and future users should incorporate the edit in <https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca/pull/24>
- We adopted much more aggressive batch decoding, i.e., generating 20 instructions at once, which significantly reduced the cost of data generation.
- We simplified the data generation pipeline by discarding the difference between classification and non-classification instructions.
- We only generated a single instance for each instruction, instead of 2 to 3 instances as in [1].

This produced an instruction-following dataset with 52K examples obtained at a much lower cost (less than $500).
In a preliminary study, we also find our 52K generated data to be much more diverse than the data released by [self-instruct](https://github.com/yizhongw/self-instruct/blob/main/data/seed_tasks.jsonl).
We plot the below figure (in the style of Figure 2 in the [self-instruct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560) to demonstrate the diversity of our data.
The inner circle of the plot represents the root verb of the instructions, and the outer circle represents the direct objects.

## Fine-tuning

We fine-tune our models using standard Hugging Face training code.
We fine-tune LLaMA-7B and LLaMA-13B with the following hyperparameters:

| Hyperparameter | LLaMA-7B | LLaMA-13B |
|----------------|----------|-----------|
| Batch size     | 128      | 128       |
| Learning rate  | 2e-5     | 1e-5      |
| Epochs         | 3        | 5         |
| Max length     | 512      | 512       |
| Weight decay   | 0        | 0         |

To reproduce our fine-tuning runs for LLaMA, first install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Below is a command that fine-tunes LLaMA-7B with our dataset on a machine with 4 A100 80G GPUs in FSDP `full_shard` mode.
We were able to reproduce a model of similar quality as the one we hosted in our demo with the following command using **Python 3.10**.
Replace `<your_random_port>` with a port of your own, `<your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer>` with the
path to your converted checkpoint and tokenizer (following instructions in the PR), and `<your_output_dir>` with where you want to store your outputs.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \
    --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \
    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \
    --bf16 True \
    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 2000 \
    --save_total_limit 1 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --weight_decay 0. \
    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap" \
    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'LlamaDecoderLayer' \
    --tf32 True
```

The same script also works for OPT fine-tuning. Here's an example for fine-tuning OPT-6.7B

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \
    --model_name_or_path "facebook/opt-6.7b" \
    --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \
    --bf16 True \
    --output_dir <your_output_dir> \
    --num_train_epochs 3 \
    --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
    --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \
    --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
    --evaluation_strategy "no" \
    --save_strategy "steps" \
    --save_steps 2000 \
    --save_total_limit 1 \
    --learning_rate 2e-5 \
    --weight_decay 0. \
    --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
    --lr_scheduler_type "cosine" \
    --logging_steps 1 \
    --fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap" \
    --fsdp_transformer_layer_cls_to_wrap 'OPTDecoderLayer' \
    --tf32 True
```

Note the given training script is meant to be simple and easy to use, and is not particularly optimized.
To run on more gpus, you may prefer to turn down `gradient_accumulation_steps` to keep a global batch size of 128. Global batch size has not been tested for optimality.

### Addressing OOM

Naively, fine-tuning a 7B model requires about 7 x 4 x 4 = 112 GB of VRAM. Commands given above enable parameter sharding, so no redundant model copy is stored on any GPU.
If you'd like to further reduce the memory footprint, here are some options:

- Turn on CPU offload for FSDP with `--fsdp "full_shard auto_wrap offload"`. This saves VRAM at the cost of longer runtime.
- In our experience, DeepSpeed stage-3 (with offload) can at times be more memory efficient than FSDP with offload. Here's an example to use DeepSpeed stage-3 with 4 GPUs with both parameter and optimizer offload:
    ```bash
    pip install deepspeed
    torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 --master_port=<your_random_port> train.py \
        --model_name_or_path <your_path_to_hf_converted_llama_ckpt_and_tokenizer> \
        --data_path ./alpaca_data.json \
        --bf16 True \
        --output_dir <your_output_dir> \
        --num_train_epochs 3 \
        --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
        --per_device_eval_batch_size 4 \
        --gradient_accumulation_steps 8 \
        --evaluation_strategy "no" \
        --save_strategy "steps" \
        --save_steps 2000 \
        --save_total_limit 1 \
        --learning_rate 2e-5 \
        --weight_decay 0. \
        --warmup_ratio 0.03 \
        --deepspeed "./configs/default_offload_opt_param.json" \
        --tf32 True
    ```
  - The DeepSpeed library also provides some [helpful functions](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/memory.html) to estimate memory usage. 
- [LoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09685) fine-tunes low-rank slices of the query, key, and value embedding heads. This can reduce the total memory footprint from 112GB to about 7x4=28GB. We may release our re-implemention of this in the future, but for now the [peft](https://github.com/huggingface/peft) codebase can be a useful resource.

## Recovering Alpaca Weights

The weight diff between Alpaca-7B and LLaMA-7B is located [here](https://huggingface.co/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b-wdiff/tree/main).
To recover the original Alpaca-7B weights, follow these steps:
```text
1. Convert Meta's released weights into huggingface format. Follow this guide:
    https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/model_doc/llama
2. Make sure you cloned the released weight diff into your local machine. The weight diff is located at:
    https://huggingface.co/tatsu-lab/alpaca-7b/tree/main
3. Run this function with the correct paths. E.g.,
    python weight_diff.py recover --path_raw <path_to_step_1_dir> --path_diff <path_to_step_2_dir> --path_tuned <path_to_store_recovered_weights>
```

Once step 3 completes, you should have a directory with the recovered weights, from which you can load the model like the following

```python
import transformers
alpaca_model = transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("<path_to_store_recovered_weights>")
alpaca_tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("<path_to_store_recovered_weights>")
```
